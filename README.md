# Project voÌˆr : Open Knowledge modeling

---

## Synopsis

The project is initiated as a dirty hack for crawling and modeling 
a large volume of open knowledge out there in Wikipedia. Thus, we 
have a "nearly" complete graph of those knowledge, also obtain an 
ability to traverse the relations between knowledge topics.

## Setup

Install python 3.x requirements by:

```bash
  $ pip3 install -r -U requirements.txt

In an opposite direction, collect the requirements with:

  $ pipreqs .
```
